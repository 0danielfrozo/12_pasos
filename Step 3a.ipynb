      "The second order derivative can be represented geometrically as the line tangent to the curve given by the first derivative.  To discretise the second order derivative, we use the Central Difference, a combination of Forward Difference and Backward Difference of the first derivative.  Consider the Taylor expansion of $u_{i+1}$ and $u_{i-1}$:\n",
