      "What we actually do in Step 12 is split the pressure into steady and unsteady components $p=P+p'$. The applied steady pressure gradient is the constant $-\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial x}=F$ (interpreted as a source term), and the unsteady component is $\\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial x}$. So the pressure that we solve for in Step 12 is actually $p'$, which for a steady flow is in fact equal to zero everywhere.\n",

      "<b>Why did we do this?</b>\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that we use periodic boundary conditions for this flow. For a flow with a constant pressure gradient, the value of pressure on the left edge of the domain must be different from the pressure at the right edge. So we cannot apply periodic boundary conditions on the pressure directly. It is easier to fix the gradient and then solve for the perturbations in pressure.\n",

      "\n",
      "In step 12, note that the pressure field itself is not constant, but it's the pressure perturbation field that is. The pressure field varies linearly along the channel with slope equal to the pressure gradient. Also, for incompressible flows, the absolute value of the pressure is inconsequential.\n"
